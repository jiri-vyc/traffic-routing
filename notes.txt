ErrorHandling should be improved upon (single error handling function, function codes, global Error definition)

API should be RESTful. POSTing a payload just as parameters to GET some result is wrong. Either fully commit to this and use GraphQL or something, or re-design API to GET /best-alternative

The results can be slightly not precise - 1 index off (1 more record in geometry than durations annotations) - should be easy to fix

What if the routes are identical up until certain point = the result is then chosen by random (the first is taken)

Naive implementation: what can be improved:
- make the requests in parallel, promise.all after getting all route data
- then promise.all on calculating position after time and distance
- save only the distances to an array, then choose Min more efficiently than sort()

TODO:
- implement delays
